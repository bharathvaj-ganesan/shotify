# Shotify

This library helps you build a feedback form similar to [Google](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback/intl/en/learnmore.html). 

## Working

This library uses [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) built by [Niklas von Hertzen himself. The entire screenshot is created on the client side using vanilla Javascript.
The rendered image may not be 100% accurate but should be fine for sending feedback.

## Installation

#### Events

Below are the events that are emitted during the life cycle of the Shotify

* **processing**
  - Shotify is preparing the feedback screenshot
  - You can use this event to show loaders as this may take a while. Depends on the complexity of the page
* **drawing**
  - User has selected to highlight/blackout areas of the page
  - You can use this event to hide the feedback modal for example.
* **processed**
  - Feedback image is ready to be used.
  - You can use the payload image data being passed to be sent to the server.

### Methods

* init()

  Mounts the Shotify. Shotify will create DOMs needed to capture the user feedback screenshot.

* destroy()

  Will destroy Shotify instance. Though modern browsers will remove listeners attached to deleted DOMs it is a best practice to call this method when your feedback component is being destroyed so that there is no memory leak
